# Operating Systems

This repository includes three Operating Systems assignments aimed at exploring fundamental OS concepts. The projects focus on file operations, thread synchronization, and inter-process communication (IPC) using shared memory and pipes. These assignments demonstrate proficiency in low-level system programming and efficient resource management.

# File System Module - Section File (SF) Parser
## Key Features
- **Directory Listing**: Lists files and directories based on name prefixes and permissions.
- **SF File Parsing**: Validates and parses SF files, checking for compliance with the SF format.
- **Section Extraction**: Extracts and displays specific lines from sections within SF files.
- **Recursive Search**: Searches directories recursively for SF files containing specific section types.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C
- **System Calls**: `open()`, `read()`, `lseek()`, `stat()`, `opendir()`, `readdir()`
- **Development Tools**: GCC, Valgrind

## Why This Project?
This project showcases strong skills in **system programming, file handling, and low-level C programming**. It demonstrates the ability to **work with custom binary file formats** and implement **recursive directory traversal**.

# Process and Thread Synchronization

## Overview
The **Process and Thread Synchronization** project is a **C program** that demonstrates the **creation and synchronization of processes and threads** in a **Linux environment**. It uses **POSIX threads (pthread)** and **synchronization mechanisms** such as **mutexes, condition variables, and semaphores** to ensure proper execution order and resource management.

## Key Features
- **Process Hierarchy**: Creates a hierarchy of processes with specific synchronization requirements.
- **Thread Synchronization**: Controls the execution order of threads within processes.
- **Barrier for Threads**: Limits the number of threads running simultaneously using a barrier mechanism.
- **Inter-Process Thread Synchronization**: Synchronizes threads across different processes.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Threading Library**: POSIX Threads (pthread)
- **Synchronization Mechanisms**: Mutexes, Condition Variables, Semaphores
- **Development Tools**: GCC, Valgrind

## Why This Project?
This project showcases strong skills in **multi-threading, process management, and synchronization techniques**. It demonstrates the ability to **design and implement complex synchronization mechanisms**.

# Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Mechanisms

## Overview
The **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Mechanisms** project is a **C program** that demonstrates **communication between processes** using **named pipes and shared memory**. It implements a **communication protocol** to handle requests such as **creating shared memory, writing to shared memory, and reading from memory-mapped files**.

## Key Features
- **Named Pipes**: Establishes communication between processes using **named pipes**.
- **Shared Memory**: Creates and manages **shared memory regions** for inter-process communication.
- **Memory-Mapped Files**: Maps files into memory for **efficient reading and writing**.
- **Request Handling**: Handles various requests such as **PING, CREATE_SHM, WRITE_TO_SHM, and MAP_FILE**.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C
- **IPC Mechanisms**: Named Pipes, Shared Memory, Memory-Mapped Files
- **Development Tools**: GCC, Valgrind

## Why This Project?
This project showcases strong skills in **inter-process communication, shared memory management, and memory-mapped file handling**. It demonstrates the ability to **implement complex communication protocols** and manage shared resources efficiently.
